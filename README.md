# WHOSE IS VANGOGH
A deep learning project to submit for project showcase challenge in Facebook Pytorch Scholarship Challenge. I make this project to test my knowledge on what I learned and to satisfy my enthusiast of bringing what I learn into solving some real problems.

# Introduction
In the art lessons at secondary high school, the teachers usually showed me pictures from famous artists in the past to teach us about style at that time as well as to give me the inspiration. To be honest I love these painting but always have trouble telling which paintings belong to whom artist. However there are two artists I can immediately identify their style are Van Gogh and Picasso, I guess you know the reason.

When taking Introduction to Deep Learning with Pytorch on Udacity, there's a lesson about tranfering style from a painting to a photos. For me this is a good lesson but the application is not interesting enough, instead I remember what struggle me in the past (categorizing artist's painting) and wanna build a model to solve it, using convolutional neural network.

To start with this project, I want to begin with only two categories: Van Gogh and Non-Van Gogh. The model can be extended to more categories (more artists) later on.
